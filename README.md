--- Project Overview ---

This is a personal passion project designed to be a comprehensive guide for beginners to advanced learners, helping them make rapid progress in Linux and DevOps tools. If you're looking to build a solid foundation in Linux, DevOps, and related technologies/practices, this repository might be for you. Whether you're starting out or deepening your expertise, this set of guides offers structure, exercises, and real-world projects to help you move forward with more confidence. I created this repository as part of my own journey into Linux and DevOps and while I’m still learning, I wanted to share the method I used and experiences that helped me navigate these complex subjects. This project reflects everything that helped me gain confidence in solving real-world problems, and I hope it does the same for you.

--- Why Did I Choose This Project? ---

I created this project because I know how overwhelming it can be to learn Linux and DevOps. When I started, the materials were often unclear or scattered. I wanted to provide a straightforward, structured way for learners to advance without feeling stuck. This project offers a roadmap to guide learners, whether starting from zero or looking to level up their skills. My goal is to help you build practical skills and feel empowered to apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios.


--- Who Is This For? ---

    Beginners who are new to Linux and DevOps and need a structured learning path.
    Intermediate learners who have some knowledge but want to deepen their understanding and apply it practically.
    Advanced learners who want to specialize or explore more advanced topics.

Anyone willing to put in the effort to learn and grow in these fields, especially from diverse backgrounds, is welcome. If you have knowledge to share, feel free to contribute.
