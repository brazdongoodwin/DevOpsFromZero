Challenge: Creating A Name Sorting Shell Script

Objective:

Write and debug a shell script that:

    Reads a list of names from a file.
    Sorts the names alphabetically.
    Outputs the sorted list to a new file.

1. Writing the Shell Script
	Step 1: Create a File

    	  Open your terminal and create the script file:

	  touch sort_names.sh

	  Open it in a text editor like vim:

    	  vim sort_names.sh

	Step 2: Write the Script

	  Add the following lines to your file:

	  #!/bin/bash

	  # Check if the input file is provided
	  if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    	    echo "Error: No input file provided."
    	    echo "Usage: ./sort_names.sh input_file"
    	    exit 1
	  fi

	  # Check if the input file exists
	  if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
    	    echo "Error: File '$1' does not exist."
    	    exit 1
	  fi

	  # Sort the names and save them to sorted_names.txt
	  sort "$1" > sorted_names.txt
	  echo "Names have been sorted and saved to sorted_names.txt."

2. Debugging the Script
	Step 1: Make the Script Executable

	  Run:

	  chmod +x sort_names.sh

	Step 2: Test the Script

    	  Create a sample file with unsorted names:

	  echo -e "Charlie\nAlice\nBob" > names.txt

	  Run the script with the file as an argument:

    	  ./sort_names.sh names.txt

3. Troubleshooting Common Errors
    Issue 1: "Permission Denied"

    	Cause: The script is not executable.
    	
	Fix: 
	Run:
    	chmod +x sort_names.sh

    Issue 2: "No Input File Provided"

    	Cause: You ran the script without providing a file.
    	
	Fix: 
	Provide the file as an argument:
    	./sort_names.sh names.txt

    Issue 3: "File Does Not Exist"

    	Cause: The input file doesn't exist or you provided the wrong path.
    	
	Fix: 
	Double-check the file name and its path.

    Issue 4: Output Is Empty

    	Cause: The input file may be empty.
    	
	Fix: Open the input file to check its contents:
    	cat names.txt

4. Expanding the Script (Optional)

	Add enhancements for better usability:

    	Allow the user to specify the output file name:

	output_file="sorted_${1}"
	sort "$1" > "$output_file"
	echo "Names have been sorted and saved to $output_file."

	Handle spaces in names by adding double quotes:

	echo "John Doe" >> names.txt
